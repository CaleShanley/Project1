This repo contains my ToDo-List for Project1 of General Assembly. It lets a user create ToDo-lists and put tasks in them. The user can mark the list as complete as well as the tasks.

This project was quite teadious and frustraing but once you get it all working it's well worth it. The parts of this program that confused me was getting all the **Models** working and linked up correctly. Another part that really confused me was getting the Task id (`<%= t.hidden_field :list_id, :value => @list.id %>`) so that you could edit the task in that ToDo-list.
